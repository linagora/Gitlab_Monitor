## Contribution Charter
In order for the code proposed by a contribution to be accepted, it must comply with the following implementation rules of the project:
- It should integrate seamlessly into the project's architecture,
- Each feature must be accompanied by unit tests, which must also follow the same structure as the unit tests in the tests/units/ directory,
- It must pass all jobs in the project's pipeline. (To pass the code quality job, a script called check_code_quality.sh is provided in the project, which performs the same checks as those done in the pipeline.)
